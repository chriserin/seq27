Feature: Artist plays song components

  @javascript
  Scenario: Artist plays a song
    Given an artist on the new song page
    When  there is a midi output available
    And   I type the ":set output=seq27-midi-output" command
    And   I set the tempo very high in order to shrink the test
    And   I type the "mecn" sequence
    And   I type the "zz" sequence
    Then  I hear the song (via midi)
