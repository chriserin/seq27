# About Seq27

Seq27 is a midi sequencer that aims to provide:

  * Quick editing via keystrokes
  * Easy navigation via keystrokes
  * Quick pattern generation
  * Easy Pattern application

Ultimately, Seq27 is a musical composition tool and I hope it allows for the expression of the patterned musical thoughts flowing through the musical minds of all types of composers.  As a programmer, I spend all day everyday typing using the keyboard and the vim text editor and in comparison the world of mouse driven sequencer and daw software has seemed extremely tedious and cumbersome.  I want to compose with the same speed as I program, and with that gain the same fulfillment.
